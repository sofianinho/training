# MQTT tutorial and project

We will build an end to end IoT application that ties together several aspects of the MQTT protocol:
- Publish/Subscribe
- Securing the broker
- Making use of the different options of the protocol: QoS, Last will, persistance
We will use two open source projects from the Eclipse foundation: Mosquito for the broker and Paho for the client library. You will use your Arduino kits to upload metrics through your Raspberry Pis using MQTT. 

## General setup

In this first section, we will setup our systems to play with MQTT and IoT

### Prepare your system

### Configuration 

### Getting to know and use Mosquito

### Observe the packets

### Setup of basic auth and more

### Installing a mobile application for MQTT

## Writing our client program

### Getting to know Paho 

### Writing your publish and subscribe programs

### Last will, reconnection, persistance

### Setting up options for QoS 1 and QoS 2

## Using the kit

### See the examples given in the Arduino folder

### Read the metrics from RPi

### Integration
